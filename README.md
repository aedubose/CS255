SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass is an application that will help consumers pass the written and road tests for their state from an online training application. Liam, the owner of the project wants to create a application that will help individuals by giving them better driver training and practice tests online. The system that the owner wants is a cloud-based application that is accessed online from customers to apply and register for courses.

I believe that I accomplished the needed requirements to apply to this application to make it functional and deliverable to the owner as a working component. I think if I would have spent more time on the project and have a even better understanding of what the owner and customers want I could change the way I designed the document and diagrams.
